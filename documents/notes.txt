TODO:
	Make AI mo' bettah
		Get distances / charges more accurate to make attacks better
		Test to make sure they don't dance anymore (should be fixed)
			Keep fixing: AI still dances (much less common), but only for short periods of time (probably from close proximity cases)
				May be fixed now, needs more testing
		Make like-teamed AI more likely to stick together
		Fix pathfinding bug caused by map-wrapping
	Make loose ends compatible with wrapped map (Such as fixing pathfinding)
	Make shockwave particles
	Add more SFX
		HomingMissile charging sound
		Missile spawning sound (x5? - so spawning lots of HomingMissiles sounds impressive)
		Missile explosion sound
		Birds' wings flapping
		Bird spawning noise
		Dwarf pain sounds (x5? - so multiple dwarves can make hurty-sounds simultaneously)
		Footstep sounds (x10? - so enemies can be heard, too)
		Collision sounds
		No gems remaining sound (when player tries to charge a spell for which he doesn't have enough gems)
			(Should charging sounds have multiples?  Maybe at least copies of the same clip)
			(Some of these can be procedural, too.  Charging would be a great one for that)
	Make AI for each of the different colored wizards
	Make rendered image size compatible with *nix / Gnome interfaces (inset issue?)
	Add intro screen / start menu
	Spawn baddies constantly (not just once at the beginning)
	Render Dwarf name tags
	Add obstacles (maybe mazes or predefined settings, probably rocks and / or lava pits)
	Add victory condition
		...and mod AI accordingly  D: D: D:
	Add other basic attack options (weapons?)
	Add options menu
		Add audio balancing (technical support already implemented)
		Add keymapping (technical support already implemented)
		Add playertag choice (technical support already implemented)
	Make server for multiplayer support
	...and probably more
	
Progress this build:
	Fixed visual bug (at wrapping seams, the wrong things were being drawn first)
		(Needs more tweaking, may still be seeing visual errors)
	
Previous progress:
	Made progress on the AI
		They attack each other!
		Gave instructions if they have no gems, no target, or both
		AI no longer tries to hit Missiles with fire
		AI run away when low on health
		AI panic when target is too close
		Fixed AI tracking / pathing bug
		Fixed two major target acquisition bugs
	Added base case for loader if properties hadn't been properly set (e.g. auto-loads natives and libs)
	Fixed minor bug with OGG support
	Fixed bug with HomingMissile targeting
	Added OGG support (Horray for decreased audio file sizes - by a factor of more than 10!)
	Wizards now drop the gems they had charged
	Map wraps (currently 3200x3200, easily changeable with final values in DwimmerEngine)
	Map view now has easy-to-alter final values in DwimmerEngine (current range is 1600x1600 rendered on 80x80 grid)
	Made SFX dynamic in velocity and location
	Made SFX only play if locale is more pertinent than the current (e.g. if it's closer)
	Added some SFX
		(temporary) Fire sound effects (x5)
		(temporary) shockwave release sound (x3)
		(temporary) Shockwave charging sound (currently unsynchronized and only for player)
		
	Too much else to list ^_^
